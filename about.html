        <h1> About DWJS</h1>
        <p>Doctors Without Jobs South Africa (DWJSA) was founded to address two critical issues facing South Africa today: unemployment among qualified medical professionals and the lack of access to quality healthcare in underserved communities. By bridging this gap, DWJSA empowers unemployed doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers to make a meaningful difference where their skills are needed the most. Our mission is simple: "Empowering Unemployed Medical Professionals to Improve Healthcare in Underserved Communities."</p>

        <h1>Why DWJSA Exists</h1>
        <p>South Africa has a shortage of medical professionals in some areas and an oversupply in others. Despite their training, many newly graduated and even experienced healthcare professionals struggle to secure permanent employment. Meanwhile, rural and marginalized communities suffer from limited access to healthcare services, exacerbating the spread of diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.

            DWJSA works to resolve these challenges by:
            
            Providing job opportunities for unemployed medical professionals.
            Upskilling and training professionals to increase their employability.
            Partnering with public and private healthcare institutions to improve access to healthcare in underserved areas.
            Advocating for policy changes to address unemployment and healthcare disparities.</p>
