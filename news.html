            <h3>July 2024: Community Health Project Reaches Rural Mpumalanga</h3>
            <p>Our Community Health Project has made incredible progress in rural Mpumalanga. Partnering with local NGOs, DWJSA deployed 50 medical professionals to provide healthcare services in areas with little to no access to clinics or hospitals. Over the past two months, our team has treated over 5,000 patients, offering critical services like maternal health care, HIV screenings, and chronic disease management.
                This initiative not only brings healthcare to the communities that need it the most, but it also creates job opportunities for unemployed medical professionals looking to make a difference.
                “Seeing the immediate impact on these communities has been inspiring. Many people here had never seen a doctor before,” shared one of the volunteer doctors.</p>
       
                
                <h3>August 2024: New Training and Upskilling Workshops Launched</h3>
        <p>WJSA recently launched its Training and Upskilling Program aimed at enhancing the employability of healthcare professionals. In August, we held our first series of workshops in Cape Town, focusing on advanced clinical skills, mental health care, and digital health technologies. These workshops attracted over 200 medical professionals seeking to broaden their skill sets in an increasingly competitive job market.
            Feedback from participants has been overwhelmingly positive, with many expressing renewed hope for future job opportunities. Stay tuned as we plan to expand these workshops to Johannesburg and Durban in the coming months</p>

            <h3>September 2024: Successful Launch of the Job Placement Program</h3>
            <p>We are excited to announce the successful launch of our Job Placement Program in collaboration with the South African Department of Health. In the first phase, DWJSA has connected over 150 unemployed doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers with job opportunities across public and private healthcare facilities. These placements have been made in key areas such as Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, and Eastern Cape, where the need for healthcare workers is most urgent.
                “This program has already made a significant difference in providing healthcare to rural communities while giving doctors a chance to gain meaningful employment,” said DWJSA's Executive Director.</p>
               


        <h3>Upcoming Events</h3>
        <p>October 2024: National Job Fair for Medical Professionals. DWJSA will be hosting a national job fair in Johannesburg, providing unemployed medical professionals with the opportunity to connect with recruiters from hospitals, clinics, and NGOs across the country.
            November 2024: Training Workshops in Digital Health. Focusing on the future of healthcare, DWJSA will launch new workshops aimed at training medical professionals in telemedicine and digital health innovations.</p>
