        <h1>Our Programs</h1>
        <p>1. Job Placement Program
            We connect unemployed medical professionals with job opportunities in public and private healthcare facilities. Through partnerships with hospitals, clinics, and community-based projects, DWJSA ensures that medical professionals can put their skills to use, improving healthcare access for all South Africans.
            
            2. Training and Upskilling Program
            To increase employability, DWJSA offers various training and upskilling initiatives. These programs focus on enhancing medical professionals' skills, knowledge, and competencies, ensuring they remain competitive in an evolving healthcare landscape.
            
            3. Community Health Project
            DWJSA collaborates with community-based organizations to provide much-needed healthcare services in underserved areas. This initiative not only benefits communities but also creates job opportunities for unemployed medical professionals, allowing them to gain experience while helping those in need.
            
            4. Advocacy Program
            DWJSA actively advocates for policy reforms to tackle the root causes of unemployment among medical professionals. We engage with the government to call for increased healthcare funding and the relaxation of restrictive employment regulations, ensuring that more medical professionals can be absorbed into the workforce.</p>
